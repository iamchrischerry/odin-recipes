    <h3>How to make this crunchy Bad Boi</h3>
    <p>This recipe, if followed carefully, will produce the most sensational lasagne that your non-Italian mouth 
        has ever experienced. The ingredients are important but to nail the much sought after crunchyness,
        you <em>need</em> to be following the construction steps carefully. So get the goods, get your MEP
        <i>(fancy french words for the prepared ingredients)</i> and lock in to this <strong>god tier</strong> recipe.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Italian pasta sheets (preferably home made).</li>
        <li><strong>BIO</strong> minced meat. Make sure that motherfucker is BIO and make sure its <b>beef</b>, we're not eating pig meat here.</li>
        <li>3 <b>big</b> onions. The bigger the better here.</li>
        <li>2 red paprikas 1 green paprika.</li>
        <li>1 aubergiene. <i>Did this recipe say it was going to be traditional because it certainly won't be.</i></li>
        <li>Herbs and Spices. We're talking whatever you've got here. I'm assuming your pantry is fully loaded with the 
            goods that make food so god damn delicious. Paprika, Onion Pow, Pepper, Bay Leaf, Mustard Seeds, Cayenne Pepper. Don't be afraid. </li>
        <li><strong>Kikkoman</strong> Soy Sauce. Don't be sleeping on Kikkoman. There is some magic in that bottle that is not in other Soy Sauces.</li>
        <li>Beef stock or a cube if you want to half ass this thing.</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>White sauce. Just make it yourself. It's part of your MEP. Google it.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol> 
        <li>First things first. Dice the onions small and get them in a thicc bottom pot. NO OIL!</li>
        <li>That's right I said no oil. Read all these steps first before continuing. And if you already put oil in the pot get it out and start again!</li>
        <li>We want to sweat these onions so get a lid on them and put on a low to medium heat make sure to keep an eye on them and stir often.</li>
        <li>Dice the paprikas the same as the onions. When the onions are soft and golden (maybe 10-15 minutes then add the paprika and cook them out too.</li>
        <li>Get a frying pan on a different hob and heat it up until it's smoking and then add the minced meat.</li>
        <li>Fry the meat in batches so that it's never too crowded in the frying pan. We want them to get brown and crunchy, that's where the flavour is hidden!</li>
        <li>When the first batch is brown and toasty, add it to the onion and paprika mix and then go again with the next batch of meat.</li>
        <li>Add some spices and herbs to the pot, 2 tins of <strong>good quality</strong> tomatoes and beef stock</li>
        <li>When you are finished with the last batch of meat, pour a glass of red wine in the pan and de-glaze it. Get all that stuck flavour off the bottom and cook 
            off the wine - then add it to the pot and pour yourself a glass to drink.</li>
        <li>Get a lid on and cook over a low heat for at least an hour, preferably 3-4 hours.</li>
        <li>Once it's ready layer your lasagne out like a pro. Make sure that on the top layer you have pasta sheets and then the mozzarella cheese. This will 
            give you that crunchy top that is so important.</li>
        <li>Bake it at 180 for 30 minutes or until the pasta is cooked. If it needs a little touch up then put it under the grill for a minute or two until the 
            top layer is looking sexy af.</li>
