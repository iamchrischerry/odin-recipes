    <p>
        Soup can be anything you want it to be. Use any ingredients that you have. Cook the vegetables so that you extract the 
        flavour. Add some creamyness or some fat, add some acidity, add some salt. Season it constantly. Get creative. Blend it
        or don't. The key is flavour. You <strong>must</strong> impart flavour or it will be <em>awful.</em>
