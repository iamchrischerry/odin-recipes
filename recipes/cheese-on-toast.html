    <h3>How to make this all time classic</h3>
    <p> 
        Some British families mix a tablespoon of malt vinegar into the grated cheese and 
        add thinly sliced raw onion to the toast before adding the vinegary cheese. 
        I am partial to adding a thin layer of Marmite  to the toast before adding 
        cheese when the mood takes me. The additional saltiness makes a great hangover cure, “apparently.”
        <br>
        <br>
        But the classic recipe is simply with cheese and some Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite all these variables and versions, I am keeping my recipe simple and making it how I was taught, 
        but you can use any of these twists and tweaks if you like!

    <h4>What is the best cheese to use?</h4>
    <p>
        Mature English cheddar is without question the only thing that should be going on this.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Two slices of white bread</li>
        <li>Good, mature English cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Toast <strong>both sides</strong> of the bread until it is a deep golden brown</li>
        <li>Lean the toast against each other to stand upright for 2 minutes so they cool down slightly and crisp on both sides</li>
        <li>Lay both toasts flat on the rack and put the cheese on them. Make sure that all the edges are completely covered to prevent
            the crusts from burning. It may look like it is piled high, but it will melt down.</li>
        <li>Drizzle 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce onto each toast</li>
        <li>Grill until the cheese is bubbly and deep golden-brown in spots. Let cool for 1 to 2 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
